  - int TCODConsole::getHeightCenterRect(int x, int y, int w, int h,const wchar_t *fmt, ...);

  C versions of the functions have _utf suffixes. Unicode fonts are :
  - fonts/consolas_unicode_10x10.png
  - fonts/consolas_unicode_12x12.png
  - fonts/consolas_unicode_16x16.png
  - fonts/consolas_unicode_8x8.png

### Changed
- the random number generator module now support two algorithms (Mingos)
  Mersenne twister, used in previous versions of libtcod
  Complementary Multiply With Carry, 2 to 3 times faster and has a much better
  period. This is the default algorithm.
  You can choose the algorithm in the constructor:
  ```c
  typedef enum {
    TCOD_RNG_MT,
    TCOD_RNG_CMWC
  } TCOD_random_algo_t;
  ```
  - TCODRandom() => CMWC, default seed
  - TCODRandom(uint32 seed) => CMWC, custom seed
  - TCODRandom(TCOD_random_algo_t algo) => default seed, custom algo
  - TCODRandom(uint32 seed, TCOD_random_algo_t aldo) => custom algo and seed
- TCODConsole::printFrame now takes an extra argument: TCOD_bkgnd_flag_t
- renamed libraries on Linux to improve portability :
  - libtcod++.so  => libtcodxx.so
  - libtcod-gui.so => libtcodgui.so
- new compilation system with a debug and release version of the library
- makefiles have been moved to a makefiles subdirectory
- libtcod credits now use subcell resolution

### Fixed

### Added
- added possibility to use SDL drawing functions on top of the root console with TCODSystem::registerSDLRenderer
- added Mingos' restrictive precise angle shadow casting fov algorithm as FOV_RESTRICTIVE
- heightmap: added missing `TCOD_heightmap_set_value` function
- new consolas, dejavu, lucida and prestige fonts from Mingos

### Changed
- `TCODConsole::blit` now takes 2 float parameters:
  `static void blit(const TCODConsole *src,int xSrc, int ySrc, int wSrc, int hSrc, TCODConsole *dst, int xDst, int yDst, float foreground_alpha=1.0f, float background_alpha=1.0f)`

- added C and Python code generation in the heightmap tool
- added function to calculate the height of a printed string
  (with autowrapping) without actually printing it:

  ```
- parser: added missing `getCharProperty` when using default listener
- heightmap: added missing `TCOD_heightmap_get_value` function

- `TCODMap::computeFov` changed to support several algorithms:
  `void computeFov(int playerX,int playerY, int maxRadius,bool light_walls = true, TCOD_fov_algorithm_t algo = FOV_BASIC)`
  available algorithms :
  - FOV_BASIC: classic libtcod fov
  - FOV_DIAMOND: http://www.geocities.com/temerra/los_rays.html
  - FOV_SHADOW: http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=FOV_using_recursive_shadowcasting
  - FOV_PERMISSIVE: http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Precise_Permissive_Field_of_View
  - light_walls: if false, wall cells are not put in the fov
- `setCustomFont` changed:
  defines the font number of characters instead of character size.
  if not specified, it is deduced from the layout flag
  (16x16 for ascii, 32x8 for tcod)
  `setCustomFont(const char *fontFile, int flags=TCOD_FONT_LAYOUT_ASCII_INCOL,int nbCharHoriz=0, int nbCharVertic=0)`
  The flag values have changed too:
   - TCOD_FONT_LAYOUT_ASCII_INCOL=1
   - TCOD_FONT_LAYOUT_ASCII_INROW=2
   - TCOD_FONT_TYPE_GREYSCALE=4
   - TCOD_FONT_TYPE_GRAYSCALE=4
   - TCOD_FONT_LAYOUT_TCOD=8
- pathfinding: you don't need to provide coordinates in x,y parameters of
  `Path::walk`
- improved double/simple walls special characters in tcod layout fonts

### Fixed
- fixed SDL dependent features not being available before initRoot is called.
  If you want to draw on an offscreen console without calling initRoot, you
  need to call at least setCustomFont to initialize the font. Else characters won't be rendered.
- fixed standalone credits page erasing previously fps limit
- fixed special characters TCOD_CHAR_DTEE* and TCOD_CHAR_DCROSS not printing correctly
- fixed heightmap tool generated code not compiling
- fixed parser C++ error function not prepending file name & line number to the error message
- fixed memory leak in pathfinding
- fixed fov issue with walkable, non transparent cells
- fixed numerical stability issues with heightmap rain erosion
- fixed calculation error in heightmap kernel transformation function
- fixed TCODConsole::renderCredits being able to render the credits only once
- fixed mouse cx,cy coordinates in "padded" fullscreen modes
- fixed mouse cursor hidden when switching fullscreen
- fixed mouse coordinates when going fullscreen->windowed

## [1.4.0] - 2008-10-16
### Added
- added pathfinding module
- added BSP module
- added heightmap module + heightmap tool
- added compression toolkit
- added possibility to pre-allocate TCODList's memory
- added support for PNG images + antialiased fonts from PNG with alpha channel or greyscale
- added ASCII mapping functions to map an ascii code to any character in your font:
  - `static void TCODConsole::mapAsciiCodeToFont(int asciiCode, int fontCharX, int fontCharY);`
  - `static void TCODConsole::mapAsciiCodesToFont(int firstAsciiCode, int nbCodes, int fontCharX, int fontCharY);`
  - `static void TCODConsole::mapStringToFont(const char *s, int fontCharX, int fontCharY);`
- parser : now strings can contain octal/hexadecimal ascii values
  - myStringProperty1 = "embedded hex value : \x80"
  - myStringProperty2 = "embedded octal value : \200"
- parser : now can handle list properties.
  ```c
  myStruct {
    myProperty = [1, 2, 3]
  }
  ```
  to declare: `struct.addListProperty("myProperty",TCOD_TYPE_INT,true);`
  to read (default parser): `TCODList<int> prop(parser.getListProperty("myStruct.myProperty", TCOD_TYPE_INT));`
- added color map generator. Interpolate colors from an array of key colors :
   `TCODColor::genMap(TCODColor *map, int nbKey, TCODColor const *keyColor, int const *keyIndex)`
- added random generator backup function. You can save the state of a generator
  with `TCODRandom *TCODRandom::save()` and restore it with
  `void TCODRandom::restore(const TCODRandom *backup)`
- added simplex noise, similar to perlin but faster,
  especially in 4 dimensions and has better contrast:
  - `TCODNoise::getSimplex`
  - `TCODNoise::getFbmSimplex`
  - `TCODNoise::getTurbulenceSimplex`
  Simplex should be preferred over Perlin for most usages.
- added wavelet noise, similar to perlin, much slower but doesn't blur at high scales. Doesn't work in 4D :
  - `TCODNoise::getWavelet`
  - `TCODNoise::getFbmWavelet`
  - `TCODNoise::getTurbulenceWavelet`
  Noise functions relative times:

  |       |2D|3D|4D|
  |:------|-:|-:|-:|
  |simplex| 1| 1| 1|
  |perlin | 4| 5|17|
  |wavelet|32|14| X|
- you can capture a console to an existing image without creating a new image
  with `TCODImage::refreshConsole`
- non rectangular offscreen consoles:
  you can define a key color on offscreen consoles.
  Cells for which background color = key color are not blitted
- added libtcod credits function. You can either call:
  `TCODConsole::credits()` to print the credits page at the start of your game
  (just after `initRoot`) or
  `bool TCODConsole::renderCredits(int x, int y, bool alpha)` to print the
  credits on top of one of your existing page (your game menu for example).
  Call it until it returns true.

### Changed
- Noise functions renamed:
  - `TCODNoise::getNoise` -> `TCODNoise::getPerlin`
  - `TCODNoise::getFbm` -> `TCODNoise::getFbmPerlin`
  - `TCODNoise::getTurbulence` -> `TCODNoise::getTurbulencePerlin`
- Some special char constants `TCOD_CHAR_x` added/removed
- `setCustomFont` changed:
  `setCustomFont(const char *fontFile,int charWidth=8, int charHeight=8, int flags=0)`
  flags:
  - TCOD_FONT_LAYOUT_ASCII_INROW=1
  - TCOD_FONT_TYPE_GREYSCALE=2
  - TCOD_FONT_LAYOUT_TCOD=4
- improved `TCODConsole::flush` performances:
   frames per second for sample "True colors" (terminal.png font) on my
   reference computer (windowed mode):
   - libtcod 1.3.2:  130
   - libtcod 1.4.0:  300
- `TCODNoise::getTurbulence` is twice faster
- improved mouse click detection. Even with a low framerate, mouse clicks will
  always be detected and reported in the `Xbutton_pressed` fields of
  `TCOD_mouse_t`
- you don't need anymore to provide values in `TCODLine::step` parameters

### Fixed
- fixed memory leak in image module
- fixed DELETE and INSERT keys not detected

  - `rbutton_pressed`: right button pressed event
  - `mbutton_pressed`: middle button pressed event

  and to get the mouse movement in cell coordinates (instead of pixels)
- added functions to retrieve data from TCODMap

### Changed
- now TCODConsole::putChar/setChar can use ascii code > 255 (ok, it's no more an ascii code, then)
  this allows you to use fonts with more than 255 characters.

### Fixed
- fixed const correctness in `TCODConsole::print*Rect` functions
- fixed a bug in fov toolkit if TCODMap width < height
- fixed `TCOD_struct_get_type` returning `TCOD_TYPE_NONE` instead of
  `TCOD_TYPE_BOOL` for flags.

## [1.3] - 2008-05-25
### Added
- added mouse support
- added the file parser module
- added TCODColor::setHSV(float h, float s, float v) and TCODColor::getHSV(float *h, float *s, float *v)
- added TCODColor addition and scalar multiplication. All r,g,b values are clamped to [0-255] :
  - C++: `color1 = color2 * 3.5f;`
         `color1 = color1 + color2;`
  - C  : `color1 = TCOD_color_multiply_scalar(color2, 3.5f);`
         `color1 = TCOD_color_add(color1, color2);`
- added `TCODConsole::setKeyboardRepeat(int initialDelay, int interval)` and
  `TCODConsole::disableKeyboardRepeat()`
- added `TCODSystem::getCurrentResolution(int *w, int *h)`

### Changed
- C++ : colors must be initialized by constructor:
  - 1.2.2 : `TCODColor mycol={r,g,b};`
  - 1.3   : `TCODColor mycol(r,g,b);`
- TCOD_console_check_for_keypress now has a parameter that indicates which events are tracked
  - 1.2.2 : `key = TCOD_console_check_for_keypress();`
  - 1.3   : `key = TCOD_console_check_for_keypress(TCOD_KEY_PRESSED);`
- now `TCODFov::computeFov` takes a maxRadius parameter.
  Use 0 for unlimited range (default)
- the mouse cursor is now automatically hidden when using fullscreen
- fixed closing the window resulting in a fake 'Q' keyboard event
- fixed `TCODConsole::print*` and `TCODConsole::rect` functions crashing when
  printing out of the console
- fixed `f` parameter modified when calling fbm and turbulence noise functions.
  Now `f` is no more modified.

### Fixed
- fixed TCODConsole::print*Rect functions not truncating the string if it reaches the bottom of the rectangle
  using a rectangle height of 0 means unlimited height
- fixed a color bug when drawing text using the black color (0,0,0)
- fixed TCODConsole::waitForKeypress(true) resulting in Alt/Ctrl/Shift key state not cleared

## [1.2.1] - 2008-03-09
### Added
- added TCODImage::blitRect to easily map an image on a specific part of a console
- added possibility to generate an image from an offscreen console
- added TCODImage::save
- image toolkit now support reading 8bpp bitmap files.

### Changed
- Random number generators now support inverted ranges instead of crashing:
  `TCODRandom::getInstance()->getInt(10,2)`
  => return a value between 2 and 10.

### Fixed
- fixed image toolkit replacing the green component by the red one when loading a bitmap from a file
- fixed console print*Rect functions unnecessarily splitting the string in some cases
- on Linux, you don't need to link with SDL anymore when using libtcod/libtcod++
- fixed linker issues with Visual Studio

- now windowed mode works even on 16bits desktops
- improved custom font support.
  You can now use fonts with characters ordered in rows or columns and with a custom transparent color.
  This allows you to use most existing character sets with the doryen library.
  Font characters with grayscale are still not supported.
- new time functions:
  - `uint32 TCODSystem::getElapsedMilli()`
  - `float TCODSystem::getElapsedSeconds()`
- new background blending modes (see the line sample for a demo) :
  - TCOD_BKGND_LIGHTEN : newbk = MAX(oldbk,curbk)
  - TCOD_BKGND_DARKEN  : newbk = MIN(oldbk,curbk)
  - TCOD_BKGND_SCREEN  : newbk = white - (white - oldbk) * (white - curbk) // inverse of multiply : (1-newbk) = (1-oldbk)*(1-curbk)
  - TCOD_BKGND_COLOR_DODGE : newbk = curbk / (white - oldbk)
  - TCOD_BKGND_COLOR_BURN : newbk = white - (white - oldbk) / curbk
  - TCOD_BKGND_ADD : newbk = oldbk + curbk
  - TCOD_BKGND_ADDALPHA(alpha) : newbk = oldbk + alpha * curbk, 0.0<=alpha<=1.0
  - TCOD_BKGND_BURN : newbk = oldbk + curbk - white
  - TCOD_BKGND_OVERLAY : newbk = curbk <= 0.5 ? 2*curbk*oldbk : white - 2*(white-curbk)*(white-oldbk)
  - TCOD_BKGND_ALPHA(alpha) : newbk = (1.0f-alpha)*oldbk + alpha*(curbk-oldbk), 0.0<=alpha<=1.0
- The samples can now use custom bitmap fonts / screen resolution. Use following syntax :
  sample_c[pp] [options]
  options :
  * -fullscreen : start directly in fullscreen mode
  * -font <font_filename> (default "terminal.bmp")
  * -font-char-size <char_width> <char_height> (default 8 8)
  * -font-layout <nb_char_horiz> <nb_char_vertic> (default 16 16)
  * -font-in-row : characters in the bitmap are ordered in rows (default : columns)
  * -font-key-color <r> <g> <b> : transparent color, r,g,b between 0 and 255. (default 0 0 0)
  * -fullscreen-resolution <width> <height> (default 640 400)

### Changed
- headers renamed from `tcodlib.h*` to `libtcod.h*`
- on Linux, the library is split into `libtcod.so` and `libtcod++.so`
  allowing C developers to use it without installing g++
- the font name is no more a parameter of `TCODConsole::initRoot`
- `TCODConsole::setBitmapFontSize` renamed to `TCODConsole::setCustomFont`
- `TCODConsole::printFrame` is now a variadic function, like the other text output functions
- some background blending flags have been renamed:

  - `TCOD_BKGND_BK` replaced by `TCOD_BKGND_SET`
- the fov toolkit now uses two properties per cell : `transparent`/`walkable`.
  This is necessary to fix a fov issue with window cells (transparent, but not walkable).
  `void TCODFov::setTransparent(int x,int y, bool isTransparent)` has been replaced by :
  `void TCODFov::setProperties(int x,int y, bool isTransparent, bool isWalkable)`
- improved const correctness, added some default parameter values in the C++ API.

### Fixed
- fixed the window size when using a custom font size
- fixed `TCODK_PRINTSCREEN` key event not detected
